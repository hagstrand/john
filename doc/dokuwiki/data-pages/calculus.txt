==Definitions and Symbols==

See http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_math_operators.html for a list of unicode math symbols.

'''Real Number''' ℝ.  All the numbers, including fractions, decimals, and negatives.  Everything except the square-root of -1.  Represented by ℝ.

'''Natural Number''' ℕ.  The counting numbers.  Positive integers.  Represented by ℕ.

'''Transcendental Number'''.  pi. π

'''pi''' π.  Constant 3.14.

'''Scalar'''.  A single number.  Represented by a lowercase italic variable name, like ''n''.

'''Element of''' ∈.  For example, we might say Let ''s'' ∈ ℝ represent the slope, defining ''s'' as a real number.  Or we might say Let ''n'' ∈ ℕ represent the number of units, defining ''n'' as a natural number.

'''Vector'''.  An array of numbers.  Represented by a boldface lowercase italic variable name, like '''''x'''''.

Calculus (from Latin calculus, literally 'small pebble', used for counting and calculations, like on an abacus)[1] is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that

  * geometry: the study of shape
  * algebra: the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations
  * calculus: the mathematical study of continuous change
  * differential calculus: rates of change and slopes of curves
  * integral calculus: accumulation of quantities and the areas under and between curves

  * These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus.
  * Both branches make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.
  * Generally, modern calculus is considered to have been developed in the 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz.

Fundamental theorem of calculus: differentiation is the reverse of integration.

  * Differentiate
  * Integrate

  * Differential
  * Integral

  * Differentiate - to find the derivative of a function
  * Differentiation - the process of finding the derivative of a function

  * Differential
  * Derive
  * Derivative - in geometry, the slope of the tangent line of the function at the point of tangency

Differential equations are equations involving derivatives.

Limit

Infinitesimal - an infinitely small number, often represented by dx and dy. dx/dy is their ratio.

Limits - small numbers represented by epsilon, delta.  Describe the value of a function at certain input in terms of its values at a nearby input.

Differential calculus -  the study of the definition, properties, and applications of the derivative of a function.

f is the original function, and f-prime is its derivative.
if f(x) = x2 is the squaring function,
then f′(x) = 2x is its derivative, the doubling function.

Differential equation is derived from the original function.
The original function is input to the differential function.
